Dental Center Clinics Automation 
 The application allows patients to register, view their medical records, book appointments, and communicate with doctors (chatting with Pusher). It also allows doctors to follow up with patients, record treatment session information in the patient's record, and monitor treatment plans. Secretaries can manage appointment scheduling, and administrators have full control over the clinic's management.
